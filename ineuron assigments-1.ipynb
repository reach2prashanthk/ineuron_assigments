    "#1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be\n",
    "#integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) *  is an  expression\n",
    "2) 'hello' is a string value\n",
    "3) -87.8 is  a value\n",
    "4)- is an expression\n",
    "5) / is an expression\n",
    "6) + is an expression\n",
    "7)  is a value\n",

    "\n",
    "2) What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single    quotes' ' or double quotes, strings are used whenever we         represent textual form of data ex: my_string = \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Numeric type\n",
    "\n",
    "     int=Represents whole numbers, such as 1, 2, -3, etc.\n",
    "     float=Represents decimal numbers, such as 3.14, -0.5, etc.\n",
    "     complex=Represents numbers in the form of a + bj, where a and b are floats, and j is the imaginary unit.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Boolean Type: Represents either True or False, used for logical operations and conditional statements.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "     Sequence Types:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     List=an ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets, can contain elements of different types.ex=list=                     [1,2,3,'hello',5]\n",
    "     Tuple: contains an ordered immutable collection of itemsenclosed by parenthesis\n",
    "            ex_tuple=(1,2,3,'prashanth')\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "     Text Type:String (str): Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes, such as \"Hello, World!\".\n",

    "     \n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do? \n",
    "Ans: an expression is a combination of literals,variables,operators,literals,operators, and a function call which can be evaluated to produce a value\n",
    "Ex: sum=1+2+3\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    " 5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "Ans: expressions are used to compute values while statements like spam=10 is used to hold the value '10' on variable name 'spam'\n",
    " we can use this statement as an expression like sum=spam+10      where sum will be 20\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?bacon = 22, bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: bacon contains 23 since its value increased by 1\n",
    "  \n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?'spam'+'spamspam'   and 'spam'*3\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: since 'spam' is a string and do not contacin any variable\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam'+'spamspam'='spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "'spam'*3='spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",

    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ans:  Python allows the use of descriptive words or phrases as    variable names  as long as variable do not contacin any reserverd words\n",
    "while 100 is an  invalid variable name because it starts with a digit, Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore\n",

    "    \n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ans: int(),float(),str()\n",
    "     ex: value=10\n",

    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    " 'i have eaten'+99+'burritos'\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: this will cause an error 'TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to str' \n",
    "\n",
    "enclosing 99 under quotes will execute the result 'i have eaten99burritos'\n",
