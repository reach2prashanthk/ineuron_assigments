    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "Functions reduce the need for duplicate code,By including functions, we can prevent repeating the same code block repeatedly in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be written in a way that promotes reusability across different projects or parts of the same project\n",
    "\n",
    "By breaking a program into smaller functions, each responsible for a specific task, you can better organize and manage the codebase\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Readability:Functions are helpful in understanding the code by dividing a large program into smaller and meaningful sections\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in a function runs when the function is called\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "typically called a \"function definition\", In Python, the def statement is used to define a function.\n",
    "ex: def function_name(parameters):\n",
    "                # Code block or statements\n",
    "                that make up the function's body\n",
    "                \n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: for ex: def function(name):\n",
    "    print(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n",
    "    #functin defined but not executed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "function(\"Prashanth\")\n",
    "#calling function\n",
    "\n",
    "function is a named block of reusable code that performs a specific task of actions.\n",
    "function call is the instruction that triggers the execution of the statements within the function's code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "global scope: It is the scope in which variables and functions are defined outside of any specific function or class, typically python has one global scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Local scope: it contain variables that are defined within the function or method and are accessible only within that particular scope.multiple local scopes can exist if multiple functions are called as these are temporarily created\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "glob_variable = 100  #  variable defined in the global scope\n",
    "\n",
    "def _function():\n",
    "    loc_variable = 50 # Local variable defined in the local scope of the function\n",
    "    print(loc_variable)  # Accessing the local variable\n",
    "    print(glob_variable)  # Accessing the global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "_function()  # Function call\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "Ans: These are created when the function is called and exist only as long as the function is executing\n",
    " Once the function call returns and the execution leaves the code block the locl scope will get deleted\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: when return statement is executed  during the function's execution, the function exits immediately, and the specified value is passed back to the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "usually return statement returns the value like below ex: \n",
    "def add_sum(a,b):\n",
    "  sum=a+b\n",
    "  return sum #which will fetch the sum of two variables a and b\n",
    "  \n",
    "result=add_sum(2,3)\n",
    "print(result) # which will fetch result 5\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Its possible to have a return value in an expression  per below ex:\n",
    "def cube(a):\n",
    "    return x*x*x\n",
    "\n",
    "result = cube(5)+cube(4) #this result value is result of calling the function twice and adds the final result will be 189\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: the return value of a call to that function is None.\n",
    "\n",
    "for ex def my_function(name):\n",
    "           print('hello'+name+'!')\n",
    "           \n",
    "result=my_function(prashanth)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "there is no explicit return statement, when function is called with argument 'prashanth' but still prints due to print statement associated with it\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: we can use the global keyword in Python.\n",
    "     for ex:\n",
    "    global_varible=100\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    global global_variable\n",
    "    global_variable=20\n",
    "    \n",
    "print(global_varible) #output is 100\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()\n",
    "print(global_variable) #ouput is 20\n",
    "\n",
    "global keyword is used to indicate that the variable global_variable refers to the global variable rather than creating a new local variable.\n",
    "    \n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: None in Python is NoneType. None is a special value in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value.\n",
    "\n",
    "ex: result=None\n",
    "print(type(None)) # prints  #<class 'NoneType'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: This Will  'result in a ModuleNotFoundError'\n",
    "     if the areallyourpetsnamederic module is available in python the import statement will import the entire module\n",
    "     \n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam? \n",
    "Ans: after importing spam module, we'll call th bacon() feature as \n",
    "\n",
    "ex: import spam\n",
    "    spam.bacon()\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: we need to use error handling techniques such as Try-Except Blocks and use 'Logging' feature to capture the information about error\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex: Try clause is a block code where we seek the possibiliy of occurance of error, by enclosing the code within try clause we're instructing python to check the code for an error anf if occurs immediately transfer the control to except clause\n",
    "\n",
    "    except clause allows you to catch and handle exceptions within     controlled environment\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "ex: try:\n",
    "     Code that might cause an exception\n",
    "    result = 1 / 0  # Division by zero - ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    # Code to handle the ZeroDivisionError exception\n",
    "    print(\"Divide by zero is not allowed enter an integer.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "By using the try and except clauses together, we  can monitor and handle exceptions, allowing  program to handle errors  and continue execution rather than crashing.\n"
