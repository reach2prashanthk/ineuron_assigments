    "    Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. It hides the internal state of objects from the outside world and restricts direct access to some of an object's components. \n",
    "    Inheritance: Inheritance allows a class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass/base class). It enables the creation of new classes based on existing classes\n",
    "    Polymorphism: Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Polymorphism enables flexibility and dynamic behavior in the software. \n",
